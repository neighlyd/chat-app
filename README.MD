# Chat App

This is a chat app designed to learn websockets using the [socket.io](https://socket.io) library. Users can either create new chat rooms or join existing ones by providing a username and room name.

> Notice: Usernames are unique per room.

Once in a room, the users can chat or share their geolocation informaiton with one another in real time.

Each chatroom contains a sidebar that has the name of the chatroom and a list of the users. This information is updated dynamically as users enter and leave the room.
